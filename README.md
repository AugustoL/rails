# Rails

A DxDAO product to empower users through fast, cheap and painless L2 crypto micropayments.

Powered by Loopring Pay.

The demo app is currently published on Netlify [here](https://dxdao-rails.netlify.app/), if you want to test it out (even though the official v1 release is going to be put on IPFS with a dedicated ENS pointer to make it truly decentralized).
